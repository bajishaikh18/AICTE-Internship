Human Pose Estimation Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting and tracking human poses in real-time using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes models like OpenPose or similar architectures to identify key body joints and estimate the overall pose of a person from images or video streams. The system analyzes the detected landmarks to track the movement and positioning of human bodies, which can be applied to various domains such as fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction. The project is built with Python, leveraging libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and mediapipe.

Pose Estimation App
This app leverages machine learning models to perform human pose estimation on both images and videos. It accurately identifies and tracks key body points such as limbs and joints, allowing for precise body movement analysis. Ideal for applications in fitness, sports, and health monitoring, the app can be used for real-time tracking or analyzing pre-recorded media. Users can upload an image or video, and the app will output the pose information, displayed as key points on the body.
